            <p>
                This mindset has guided me throughout my life, from building my first car at age 13 and working in a mechanic shop, to now focusing on programming languages such as Python and JavaScript. Most recently, I have developed a strong interest in data analytics. Although this is a newer area for me, I have found that the core values required—curiosity, persistence, and adaptability—are consistent with those I have practiced throughout my experiences. I am eager to continue applying these principles as I grow in my career.
